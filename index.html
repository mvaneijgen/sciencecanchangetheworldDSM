					<h2>A far-sighted approach to science</h2>
					<p>What if you could bring together two utterly different branches of science to help people cope better with major illness?</p>
					<p>For years DSM has been a leader in both food and nutritional products; as well as performance materials (or polymers) for use in consumer products. Then, several years ago, it asked the question: If we can put performance materials in a car, why not a person?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 side_img">

				<div class="col-md-8 collapse exerp_1">
					<p>Today, biomaterials from DSM are being used worldwide &ndash; not least to deliver drugs inside the human body (for example from stents used to treat the heart). The concept is simple: The material implant slowly delivers medication to a specific organ until all the medicine is gone&hellip;and then the body simply and safety absorbs it - with no need for surgery or medical procedures.</p>
					<p>Fabulous news for people with heart problems. But what if you&rsquo;re one of the millions of people suffering from a chronic eye disease like glaucoma?</p>
					<p>This is the next big un-met societal need now being tackled by DSM&rsquo;s Jens Thies and his team. If successful, their polymeric implant could eventually eliminate the need for the daily application of eye drops for millions of glaucoma sufferers in Europe alone. But to eliminate that particular headache for patients, they had to deal with a few of their own first.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Our big roadblock was that biomaterial resorbs six times slower in the eye than in, say, the heart,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We had to find a way around this new problem, because we couldn&rsquo;t leave empty implants in the eye for that long.&rdquo; The question was, how?</p>
					<p>The reason why big companies sometimes struggle to cross-polinate their knowledge, says Jens, is that you not only need to find the right people (there are more than 2,500 scientists in DSM) but also the right way to communicate with them - and bridge that knowledge gap.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;The stark truth is that science is not a common language &ndash; certainly when taken to the very, very advanced level that we require. Once we&rsquo;d found the right colleagues to help us we had to bring the conversation down to an almost high school level &ndash; and then bring it back up again.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>It's this ability to connect and then &lsquo;translate&rsquo; as he calls it, that has led to human clinical trials now planned for 2016. &ldquo;We had to understand the disease and anatomy from scratch, and this is where our connections to other DSM scientists and external experts have been invaluable. We all went beyond our comfort zone.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>And it&rsquo;s this capability that will increasingly define DSM&rsquo;s abilty to produce science that has a positive effect on peoples&rsquo; lives. A far-sighted approach indeed&hellip;</p>

					<h2>The milk of human kindness</h2>
					<p>Back in 1973 a young grad student was shown the molecular structure of a then largely-ignored omega 3 acid called DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid). &ldquo;I knew immediately that what I was looking at was beautiful, elaborate and different from any molecule I'd ever seen,&rdquo; says Dr Norman Salem of DSM.</p>
					<p>Today, DHA is a staple of infant milk formulations and can be found in everything from sports drinks to supplements &ndash; largely thanks to its ability to increase human brain and eye function, as well as immunity to disease. And Norman has been there every step of the way&hellip;</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 side_img">
					<img src="assets/img/scientists/scientist03_side.jpg">

				<div class="col-md-4 side_img collapse exerp_1">

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 collapse exerp_1">
					<p>&ldquo;Although sourced primarily from oily fish like mackerel, DHA is also found in incredibly high concentrations in human breast milk,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know much about nutrition back then but it occurred to me: &lsquo;What happens to all those children who aren&rsquo;t breast-fed? How do we ensure they get their DHA?&rdquo;</p>
					<p>For the next 30 years, Norman championed the cause of DHA as a nutritional supplement through his work at the National Health Institute in the United States. The big breakthrough came through a series of supplementation and deficiency studies in 80s and 90s. &ldquo;We began to realize that memory and learning really were significantly affected by DHA,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;There was no big drama, just a long and arduous road.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Finally, in 2001, the Federal Drug Administration agreed with him. It granted approval for DHA in infant milk and other applications.</p>
					<p>Job done? Not quite. With DHA firmly established on supermarket shelves, Norman could have forgiven for taking comfortable retirement &ndash; until in 2007 he was persuaded to join the commercial sector, developing a second generation of DHA. &ldquo;I decided I wanted to finish the job I started all those years ago.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Today, Norman and his team at DSM are perfecting new ways to produce DHA, not from oily fish, but from algae.</p>
					<p>The new process for algae-based DHA will be more efficient and thus more affordable for young mothers and other consumers; and just as importantly it will have no impact on the world&rsquo;s dwindling wild fish stocks.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;I got into this branch of science to improve public health. But now we&rsquo;re discovering entirely new ways to benefit society,&rdquo; says Norman.</p>
					<p>Some 43-years later, scientific curiosity still hasn&rsquo;t got the better of him&hellip;</p>
